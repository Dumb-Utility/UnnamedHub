# UnnamedHub

UnnamedHub is an open-source script hub for [ROBLOX](https://roblox.com/) with multiple game supports for scripting needs.

# Content
UnnamedHub is showing itself as a "hidden" gui with the minecraft client type of gui with a button to open the gui and multiple category for the specified game.

A game support by UnnamedHub will mostly have ServerSide type of content then ClientSide since it's always fun to have others know what is happening.

# Installation

UnnamedHub isn't an external application and only require to have an Executor/Exploit [(Where do I get an executor)](https://github.com/Dumb-Utility/UnnamedHub/blob/main/Resources/GetAnExploits.md) and a brain.

You only need to copy and paste this script into your executor and execute it.
```lua
-- UnnamedHub by that one guy called Error-Cezar.
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dumb-Utility/UnnamedHub/main/UH.lua'))()
```
