# How/Where to get an executor ?
Hello, this is a small Tutorial to explain everything about exploits if you are new to the scene.

## What is an executor/exploit ?
A exploit is an external application made for ROBLOX that is used to get advantages in a game by using the LUA language and in-game vulnerabilities.
A exploit will most of the time be considered as a *virus* because of the fact that it inject itself inside the game to use LUA scripts.
Exploits scripts aren't ServerSide based because of ROBLOX's Filtering Enabled (FE) but they can currently be server sided via in-game vulnerabilities.

## Where can I get a good free exploits?
Here is a list of recommanded/not recommanded exploits:

[**JJSploit**](https://wearedevs.net/d/JJSploit): **Not Recommanded** | Crashes a lot and limited functions (less script supported)

[**KRNL**](https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/Krnl): **Recommanded** | Less crashes, good amount of script support but have a long key system

[**Fluxus**](https://fluxteam.net/): **Recommanded** | Like KRNL but way shorter key system

## What about paid ones?

[**Synapse X 15-20$**](https://x.synapse.to/): **Recommanded** | Cheap, Rare crashes, most script support, stable, no bullshit

[**Script-Ware 12-20$**](https://https://script-ware.com/): **Recommanded** | Cheap, MAC, IOS, Windows, Lot of utility function (maybe too much), also get good script support
